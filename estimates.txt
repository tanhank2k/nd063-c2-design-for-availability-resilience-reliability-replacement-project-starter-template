1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage
- In the case of a single AZ outage, the RTO is primarily determined by the time it takes for AWS RDS to failover
- Failover Process: Generally takes 1-2 minutes, but can extend up to 5 minutes if there are complications such as needing to recover a large transaction log
=> 2-5 minutes
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage.
- The RTO includes the time required to promote a read replica in another region to a standalone or primary DB instance and redirect the traffic to this new primary DB.
- Promotion of Read Replica: up to 15 minutes 
- DNS Update and Traffic Redirection: 5~15 minutes
Total: Typically ranges from 15 to 30 minutes
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage
- In a Multi-AZ RDS configuration: Synchronous replication is used between the primary and the standby databases in different AZs
=> Close to zero.
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage
- Estimated Minimum RPO: This can vary significantly based on replication lag which might range from a few seconds to minutes
